Example for source code inclusion. It is enough to report only the part
of \verb=multiperiod.py= that has been changed, that is, the function
\verb=solve=.

\begin{lstlisting}
def solve(data):
    m = Model("fpmm")
    m.setParam(GRB.param.Method, 0)
    
    ######### BEGIN: Write here your models
    
    
    
    ######### END
     
    # check the model
    m.write("model.lp")
    def printSolution():
         ## implement this function
         pass
    m.optimize()
    printSolution()
    return m.objVal

\end{lstlisting}
